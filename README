What is this?
-------------
I felt a bit bad about not putting many code samples out there on the internet, so I decided to do a large, multi-language portfolio piece. It's being done like a project, starting at the requirements definition phase and ending with a polished final product, except I happen to be the only person assigned to it :) 

What languages will be included?
------------
Java's my favorite, so I'm starting there with a server and client pair, then I plan to put clients in other languages such as perl, python, maybe some C#.net... if I feel like it, I may add a PhP REST server implementation for shits and grins.
